# Artificial-NN
# The model in this project just gives binary predictions and loss value as an output. As an addition I've added a matrix that gives out the total correct and incorrect predictions with the final loss output.
# I've tested out a few values to get the best loss output.
# The project is based on whether a customer will leave the bank or not, and the basis is not one criteria.
